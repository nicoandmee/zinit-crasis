revision 81116e26. This real-world test revealed that "-q" given to cdreplay is
not preserved in output (i.e. when saving). However, when trying to reproduce,
it was missing only in UI. Fixed this in previous commit. The code uses functions
so it's not a typical zshrc. TODO are comments after custom commands (i.e. not
zplugin calls). The test also moves not-added zplugin command together with its
comment.
